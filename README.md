# CUET-Admission
<h4>I have developed this admission process as my database course project using PHP and MySql. As it was a database project, concentration was given mainly on database operations rather than UI. Hence the UI is not so interactive. This project was created in 2013. Later mysql operations were updated to support the latest php versions.</h4>
